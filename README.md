# Statistical Methods in Python â€“ Dice Simulation

This project was created as part of the **Statistical Methods in Computer Science** course.  
It demonstrates concepts of probability and the Law of Large Numbers using **dice roll simulations** in Python.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The tasks simulate rolling dice multiple times and calculating the **sample average**.  
Results are visualized with **bar charts** to show how averages stabilize as the number of rolls increases.

Key experiments:
- Rolling 2 dice and computing the average :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Repeating the experiment 20 times and plotting results :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Rolling 10 dice, repeated 40 times, and observing averages :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Rolling 5 or 10 dice with averages shown across multiple iterations :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
