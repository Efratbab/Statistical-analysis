# Statistical Methods in Python â€“ Dice Simulation

This project was created as part of the **Statistical Methods in Computer Science** course.  
It demonstrates probability concepts and the **Law of Large Numbers** via dice-roll simulations in Python.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The tasks simulate rolling dice multiple times and computing the **sample average**.  
Results are visualized with **bar charts** to show how averages stabilize as the number of rolls increases.

Key experiments:
- Rolling 2 dice and computing a single sample average.
- Repeating the 2-dice experiment 20 times and plotting the averages.
- Rolling 10 dice, repeating 40 times, and plotting the averages.
- Rolling 5 or 10 dice, repeating multiple times, and comparing average behavior across different sample sizes.
